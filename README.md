# CAUTION
THIS PROJECT DROPS A TEXT FILE "Logging" actions you did! This is NOT malicous, and just added for fun!

Run the program, add a user, remove it, edit it, then close it and check your desktop for a file which has been dropped called RamanCooporation_Log.txt


(Bare in mind, this is not meant to be used for the public, you can, but this code is really barebones. I'd recommend searching for better things.)

the EditRegisteredUsers method has a few bugs waiting to be fixed (someone please pull a request fixing this i had spend enough time on this shit :SOB:
